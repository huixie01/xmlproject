# xmlproject
Assume your library will be used in a production environment.  
It should be structured and written to be maintainable, flexible and extensible.  
Anything you wouldn’t normally do in such a situation please make note of in a comment 
(it’s fine, this is just an exercise and we won’t really be using it in a production environment). 
All code must be Java 8 compatible.  Please use any Java 8 features where appropriate (Lambdas, Generics, concurrency, etc.). 
But, don’t use them just to use them. 
Use any 3rd party open source library you would like. 
Provide a main() method that demonstrates the usage of your library. 
Provide a build script that produces a runnable JAR file (e.g. java -jar transform.jar). 

# installation and run
create a subdirectory called xmlRadioLibrary
clone the repository
put the input.xml in appropriate directory
run the FileConversion.java main()
check the output parsed element.
